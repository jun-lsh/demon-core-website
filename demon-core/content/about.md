### What is this website for?
This website seeks to comprehensively cover the history of the Demon Core, exploring the Physics concepts behind radioactivity and criticality, the principles explored in the experiments the plutonium hemispheres were used for and the two major criticality incidents the Demon Core were involved in. We wish to educate people more on the fundamentals of nuclear physics, its hazards and more. 

### Who is this website for?
This website is for those who want to learn more about nuclear physics and radiation and hopes to make the concepts behind it more interpretable and understandable, taking away some of the *spooky factor* of the silent killer that is radiation. This website is also for those with an interest in the history behind nuclear technology and safety (and those with a morbid interest in criticality events). 

The content on the website has been written under the assumption that the viewer has a preliminary understanding of particle physics, namely subatomic particles (neutrons, protons, electrons) and the structure of the atom. The website will provide introductions to the nuclear physics concepts required to fully understand the Demon Core incidents.

### How was this website made?
This website was made using [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio), with content written by Justin Lim, Edden Chew and Oh Zhi Yuan of M22504.
