## <ins>Introduction</ins>

The nucleus of an atom is composed of *neutrons* and *protons*. Atoms of the same element have the same atomic number (number of protons), but the same element may have different _**isotopes**_, where they have a different number of neutrons.

Isotopes are denoted by ${^{A}_{Z}X}$ where $X$ is the chemical symbol and $A = Z+N$ where $Z$ is the proton count and $N$ is the neutron count.

An unstable nucleus may undergo **radioactive decay** in which it spontaneously loses energy by emitting ionizing particles and radiation. This can be *alpha decay* in which an alpha particle (${^{4}_{2}\alpha}$) is ejected, *beta decay* in which either an electron and antineutrino are released (in the case of *beta-minus decay*) or a positron and neutrino are released (in the case of *beta-plus decay*). Following these forms of decay, *gamma decay* may occur in which excess energy is emitted as a gamma ray.

## <ins>Nuclear Fission</ins>

Nuclear fission is the process in which a large element (the parent nucleus) is broken down into two smaller elements (two daughter nuclei).

For very heavy nuclei, it may occur spontaneously:

<p>
\(^{238}_{\;92}U \longrightarrow ^{145}_{\;57}La + ^{90}_{35}Br + 3 ^1_0 n + \textbf{ENERGY}\)
</p>

However, fission may also be induced, in which a nucleus is excited by another neutron and undergoes fission.

<p>
\(^{239}_{\;94}Pu + ^1_0n \longrightarrow ^{141}_{\;56}Ba+ ^{92}_{36}Kr + 3 ^1_0 n + \textbf{ENERGY}\)
<p>

Here, each reaction is _triggered_ by a neutron, when it strikes a plutonium atom (which is a <a class="tooltip">fissile<span>Fissile isotopes undergo fission upon absorption of a 0 KE neutron.

isotope, which undergoes fission upon absorption of a neutron, even one of zero kinetic enegy). This in turn, produces 3 neutrons, which can then _trigger_ other such reactions.
