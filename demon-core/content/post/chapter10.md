## <ins>Excitation</ins>

Electrons and other charged particles are released during a criticality excursion. These charged particles are able to interact with the electrons in the atoms of gases in the air through attractive or repulsive forces, with there being an energy transfer taking place. Alternatively, photons (such as those in the x-rays and gamma rays emitted) are also able to transfer energy directly by being absorbed.

In both cases, enough energy is being imparted to allow electrons to attain a higher energy state known as an *excited* state, however not enough is transferred to remove it from the atom itself and ionize the atom.

Nitrogen is the main culprit behind the blue ionized air glow, with its deexcitation causing a photon to be emitted in the ultraviolet, visible and infrared band.

Deexcitation is essentially the process in which an electron of higher energy state drops back down to a lower, more stable energy state. As nitrogen is in abundance in the air, when it is excited and subsequently deexcited during a criticality excursion, a blast of blue light[^1] is observable.

[^1]: The blue glow in both accidents is sometimes incorrectly attributed to Cherenkov radiation, another process in which a blue flow is produced. It requires a charged particle to travel through a medium faster than the pahse velocity of light of the medium. Thus Cherenkov radiation is often observable in underwater assemblies. Logically, since the medium both accidents took place in was _air_, it would require the emission of close to faster-than-light particles during the excursion, which is not possible.
