## <ins>Ionizing Radiation</ins>

When molecules become ionized, *radiolysis* may occur where chemical bonds are broken, and *free radicals* may form which are highly chemically reactive and disrupt other compounds. When this occurs in human tissue, it is **extremely dangerous** and with sufficient cell damage due to ionizing radiation, it may lead to **Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS)**, the sickness which killed Daghlian and Slotin. 

## <ins>Cancer</ins>

Radiation can cause cancer due to the damage it does to cell DNA. Some cells immediately die (undergo apoptosis) upon exposure to sufficient radiation, but others have DNA damage which *prevents* apoptosis from occuring properly, leading to tumorous growths. This cancer often presents later in life after exposure to radiation.

## <ins>ARS</ins>

If the radiation exposure is sufficiently high, cell DNA is effectively *smashed* and cell reproduction (mitosis) ceases. As the body requires cells to continually be replenished, this is effectively a death sentence.

Often times, the heavily irradiated region would have radiation burns, where the skin begins to peel without growing back. The immune system would begin to fail as *white blood cells* are unable to be produced, making the individual extremely suscepitible to other infections.

The gastrointestinal tract would also begin to fail, preventing uptake of nutrients and water from consumed food. 

Put simply, the entire body begins to die and therapy can only be symptomatic at best.


Both Daghlian and Slotin were faced with painful deaths. As stated in Daghlian's medical report:

_**"The pain increased in intensity over a period of several days... Codeine and morphive relieved the pain incompletely."**_
