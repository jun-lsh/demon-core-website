## Dear Diary...

Today marks one year since Louis' passing. As I reflect on the events that day, I thank God for the opportunity to learn from one of the best, and to be alive today still in good form.

Six other people were with us in the room that day, and I was just behind Louis as I watched him operate the screwdriver. When the screwdriver eventually slipped, there was an unforgettable blue glow of ionized air coming from the core. Like any human with an instinct to survive, I ran out as fast as I could like the others. Louis, on the other hand, didn't - he knew his fate was sealed. "Well, that does it.", were his first words right after it happened.

He shouted for all of us to come back and mark exactly where we stood, so that he could measure how much radiation everyone absorbed. Standing close to Louis, I was given a 50 percent chance of survival having received a high but non-lethal dose. Over the course of my hospitalisation, I suffered from severe radiation poisoning and hair loss. Furthermore, it had made me totally infertile and I fear that it may be permanent.

While I was able to make a recovery, Louis died nine days after the accident. His body was covered in blisters and experienced burns in his internal organs. His lips went blue and he slipped into a coma. Unlike Harry, his parents were with him as he passed away.

The core was going to be used in Operation Crossroads, but time was needed for its radioactivity to drop. When the *Baker* test saw unexpected levels of radioactivity and the inability to decontaminate target warships, the next test involving the core was cancelled. It was eventually melted and used for other cores.

Looking back, I wish I could have stopped Louis from his dangerous actions. We have lost a brilliant mind as a result of recklessness twice now and two lives is two too many.

### Notes from the future

Graves would go on to lead most of the nuclear tests from 1948 through the 1950s, and became a pillar of the Los Alamos community. He managed to have a healthy second child with his wife two years after the incident. However, he would pass on in 1965 while skiing due to a heart attack. While this might be hereditary as his father too died from it, a follow-up study suggests that latent systemic damage from the accident contributed to his heart failure.

Marion Cieslicki, another victim of that fateful day, also died in the same year as Graves due to leukemia, though it is not certain whether the demon core had a direct link to his death. Notably, the guard in Daghlian's incident would also die from leukemia in 1978.
