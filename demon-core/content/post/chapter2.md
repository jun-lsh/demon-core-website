## <ins>The Chain Reaction</ins>
As previously seen, in a fission reaction, the release of neutrons can *trigger more fission reactions*. This becomes a <ins>feedback process</ins> where more and more fissionable material releases and absorbs neutrons. Under the correct conditions, a sustained chain reaction is possible.

## <ins>Neutron Multiplication</ins>
We may define $k$ (the effective neutron multiplication factor), as the number of reactions triggered from the products of 1 reaction. We continue using the example of plutonium:
<p>
\(^{239}_{\;94}Pu + ^1_0n \longrightarrow ^{141}_{\;56}Ba+ ^{92}_{36}Kr + 3 ^1_0 n + \textbf{ENERGY}\)
<p>

$k$ is important in determining how the chain reaction will proceed. 

If $k < 1$, the plutonium is `subcritical`. The number of reactions that occur in each “iteration” decreases exponentially, meaning that the reaction cannot sustain itself. 

If $k > 1$, the plutonium is `supercritical`. The number of reactions that occurs will increase exponentially. Then, as time goes on, production of neutrons and energy increases. This may be unstable, and in most cases, k will reduce until $k=1$ (or all the plutonium is used up).

Finally, $k = 1$, the sweet spot. The plutonium is called `critical`, and the number of reactions that occur at any 1 point of time should stay approximately constant. Then, this reaction should self-sustain itself while $k = 1$ and there is enough plutonium. 

There are many factors which affect $k$, which means it is often less than 1.
