## <ins>Units of Dose</ins>

As a radiation particle loses energy traveling through a material, it ionizes nearby atoms and molecules. This energy deposited is what we call a *dose* of radiation. 

Since usually we are concerned with radiation energy deposited in human tissue, the *gray* (Gy) was proposed as a unit.

$$
\text{One gray (Gy) is the amount of radiation that will deposit 1 J of energy in 1 kg of tissue}
$$

However, energy alone will not let us quantify the effects of radiation. As the *density* of ionization is important as well, we multiply the energy deposited (the dose) with a *quality factor* $Q$, which varies for neutrons of different energies.

*TODO: reference https://nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part020/part020-1004.html*

The resultant value is the *dose equivalent* with the units *sievert* (Sv).
