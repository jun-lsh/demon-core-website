"We have ordered ... that our empire accepts the provisions of their joint declaration... Cultivate the ways of rectitude, foster nobility of spirit, and work with resolution - so that you may enhance the innate glory of the imperial state and keep pace with progress of the world." - Emperor Hirohito, 15 August 1945

## Dear Diary...

Our efforts have finally paid off - the Manhattan Project is a big success!

The great news was released at 7p.m. through the radio. Celebrations will be ongoing in the streets for the next couple of days.

The team has been working tirelessly since 1939 when the war began. The result of today was the effort of over 130000 personnel working in secret for the project. I have been blessed with the honor to be a part of this with the Critical Assembly Group since last year, while still being a graduate student.

Last week, the fruits of our labor were shown to the world. Our two atomic bombs - Little Boy and Fat Man - were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Little Boy was a gun-type fission weapon, deriving its explosive power from the nuclear fission of uranium-235. Fat Man was made using plutonium-239, and previous testing at the Trinity test proved its efficacy.

In our Los Alamos laboratory, we were instructed to prepare the third bomb a few days back. The early surrender of Japan means that it would not be used anymore. Hence, the bomb was taken apart with the core still sitting in our lab. This plutonium core weighs 14 pounds and has a diameter of 3.5 inches, just like the one in Fat Man.

We have been given clearance to perform further experiments with it. This is a great opportunity to study how much neutron reflection is needed to approach supercriticality. I cannot wait to see how we can improve from our current progress.

The peace of our nation and the world did not come easy, but a bright future lies ahead of us. I will be heading to Los Alamos soon, but not before the team celebrates over some fine wine.
