### Transcript of Report

Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory of the University of California

The LA-1 accident occured on the night of August 21, 1945 at 9:55 p.m. It involved Haroutune Krikor Daghlian, Jr., the assigned physicist-operator and Private Robert J. Hemmerly, a military guard in the laboratory.

The experiment involved a delta-phase nickel coated spherical plutonium core weighing $6.2$ kilograms and an approximate density of $15.7 \text{gcm}^{-3}$. 
 
A criticality experiment had been designed to provide information about the fission characteristics of metallic plutonium. The sub-critical plutonium core would be exposed to neutrons from a small externally placed neutron source. By surrounding the sphere with the right amount of neutron reflecting material, it would counteract the existing neutron leakage and allow the sphere to achieve a delayed critical state.  

In the LA-1 accident, tungsten carbide bricks were used as a neutron reflector, each weighing $4.4$ kilograms. They were to be stacked around the sphere, altering the neutron flux of the assembly. 

The fatal experiment scheduled for the next morning called for five such bricks on each side of the sphere. Instead of waiting until the scheduled time, Daghlian conducted the experiment a night in advance. As the experiment ensued, four layers of bricks were in place and the final brick for the fifth layer was being carried to its place for a total of 236 kilograms when Daghlian noted a rapid increase in neutron flux. In an attempt to withdraw the final brick, it had slipped out of his hand and fell onto the center of the assembly, adding sufficient reflection to make the system prompt supercritical. 

This led to an exponential increase in fission rate, causing the assembly to be engulfed in a blue glow of ionized air caused by electrons and soft x-rays. 

Daghlian immediately pushed the final brick off the assembly with his right hand and dismantled the assembly. When seen at the hospital 30 minutes after the accident, he complained of numbness and tingling of his swollen hands. He would die $25$ days after the accident of acute radiation syndrome. The exposure was approximately $7.46$ Sieverts. 

The yield of this incident was $10^{16}$ fissions. The nickel canning on the plutonium core did not rupture.
