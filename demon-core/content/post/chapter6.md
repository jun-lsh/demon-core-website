## Dear Diary...

The ongoing tests on the spare core have been going smoothly. I believe it would only be a few more blocks before we reach criticality.

In order to increase the $k$ value of the core which is of subcritical mass, we place neutron reflectors around it. This would reflect outbound neutrons back into the core, increasing the number of fission reactions triggered and reducing the mass needed to reach criticality. 

We are currently using tungsten carbide bricks to surround the core, layer by layer. Each block weighs around 9.7 pounds (4.4 kg) and the whole setup with 3 layers is over 240 pounds (~ 110 kg) now. We would be able to tell when we should stop adding more bricks when the <a class="tooltip">scintillation counter<span>The device used the measure the amount of radiation coming from the core.

We have not reached there yet, but it is likely we would observe something interesting tomorrow.

Our tests have truly been rewarding so far, yet I cannot share this with anyone else. Having been working in secret for so long, I wish my family would know that I have been gaining such invaluable experience through this project and they have raised a son to be proud of.
