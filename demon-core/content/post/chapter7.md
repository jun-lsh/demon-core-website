## Dear Diary...

Today marks a terrible day for all of us at Los Alamos.

We knew that things would only go downhill when we received the news. In an incident 25 days ago, Harry had dropped a tungsten brick onto the spare core during his experiments. With four and a half layers of bricks already surrounding the assembly, the core went supercritical with a blue glow surrounding it. In his efforts to disassemble the experiment, Harry received a radiation dosage far beyond the fatal level.

A guard was with him that night, but he did not suffer the same fate as he was much further from the scene.

In his last days, Harry suffered unimaginable pain from his poisoning. He slipped into a coma today and passed away at 4.30p.m.

Perhaps it was better for him to die sooner so that he would not have to be tormented so much.

Farewell, my friend. You will be dearly missed.
