## Dear Diary...

I am very concerned for Louis at Los Alamos.

Of late, he has been quite the showman when performing his experiments. Instead of following the guidelines for working with the core, he has thrown all that out of the window to devise his own way of testing. His idea to pivot the beryllium spheres with solely the blade of a screwdriver is utterly hazardous, and I have warned him that he will be dead in a year if he keeps on doing that. Louis refuses to listen to me and still does it in front of many people, putting all of their lives at risk.

Hopefully, he will come to his senses and change soon.
