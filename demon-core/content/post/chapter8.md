Meet Louis Slotin, one of the brightest minds in the Manhattan Project. Like Daghlian, he works at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. It has been 4 years since he has been a part of the project, and now he is considering leaving. Yet, he cannot do so before he trains up a replacement to take over his role and as Slotin himself said, "I am one of the few people left here who are experienced bomb putter-togetherers". He plans to return to teaching and research into biophysics and radiobiology at the University of Chicago. Meanwhile, he is training Alvin C. Graves to replace him.

Born on 1 December 1910 to Jewish refugees, Slotin was exceptionally good in academics. He made it into the University of Manitoba at age 16 and went on to obtain a fellowship to study at King's College London several years later. Aside from earning a PhD in physical chemistry, he distinguished himself as an amateur boxer by winning the college's amateur bantamweight boxing championship. He had also volunteered for service in the Spanish Civil War, though not for taking part in the war itself but rather for the sake of thrill and go 'on a walking tour in Spain'. He had also trained to fly a fighter with the UK's Royal Air Force. In 1942, he was invited to join the Manhattan Project.

At Los Alamos, his duties consist of criticality testing, having worked with both uranium and plutonium cores. He was also in charge of assembling the core for the Trinity test, making him known as the "chief armourer of the United States" for his expertise. Post World War 2, he continues to perform the same duties with the unused core meant for the third atomic bomb on Japan.

After Daghlian's death, safety regulations were reviewed and tightened to prevent such incidents from happening again. The experimental setup for the core has also been improved. Two beryllium hemispheres are now placed around the core, acting as neutron reflectors. The top sphere has a small hole to allow the operator to manually lower it. When the spheres are in total contact with one another, the core would go supercritical. To prevent this, shims are used to keep them from doing so.

Slotin though has a different idea to keep them apart. He uses a single flat blade of a screwdriver to separate the spheres. Being quite the complacent man, he has performed this in front of observers like Graves. Needless to say, it is a very risky manoeuvre...
