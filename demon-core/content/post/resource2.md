The LA-2 accident occured on May 21, 1946 at 3:20 p.m at the Omega Site. It involved Louis Alexander Slotin, Alvin Cushman Graves, Samuel Allan Kline, Marlon Edward Cieslicki, Dwight Smith Young, Raemer Edgar Schreiber, Theodore Perlman and Private Patrick Joseph Cleary. 
<br><br>
The experiment involved the same plutonium core in the LA-1 accident, informally referred to as “Rufus”.
<br><br>
Criticality experiments at the time were conducted to verify the closeness of the core to criticality by the positioning of neutron reflectors. An experiment had not been scheduled for the day. Slotin, the physicist in charge, was about to leave for the Bikini Atoll tests and thus sought to indoctrinate his successor, Graves, in his new duties. Slotin decided to conduct an impromptu test. 
<br><br>
The system consisted of the plutonium core and two concentric hemispherical shells of beryllium which acted at the neutron reflector. The bottom hemisphere measured 13 inches in diameter and the upper hemisphere measured 9 inches in diameter. A small neutron source emitting $10^6 \text{ neutrons s}^{-1}$ was directed at the core.
<br><br>
The upper hemisphere was to be lowered over the core using a thumb hole while scintillation counters measured the relative activity from the core. This was to be done using shims according to standard protocol. Slotin had removed the shims, allowing one edge of the upper hemisphere to be in contact with the lower hemisphere while the edge 180 degrees away was resting on the tip of a flathead screwdriver. Slotin was holding the shell with his left hand with his thumb placed in the thumb hole while working the screwdriver with his right hand. 
<br><br>
By pivoting the screwdriver against the edge of the lower hemisphere, Slotin would be able to adjust the amount of neutron reflection and thus the effective neutron multiplication factor of the system, altering the neutron flux.
<br><br>
Analysing the equation for $k_{eff}$, we can see that it relies on neutron leakage from its geometry, absorption by surroundings and fission by the system. An increase in neutron reflection would decrease the amount of leakage and thus increase the value of $k_{eff}$, allowing it to get closer to 1.
<br><br>
During the experiment, the screwdriver slipped, resulting in a criticality excursion. The hemispheres had made contact, providing sufficient neutron reflection for the core to go prompt-supercritical. 
<br><br>
In this case, neutron leakage had fallen sufficiently to cause $k_{eff}$ to go over 1, causing the assembly to go supercritical.
<br><br>
Witness reports stated that despite the room being well lit by the sun, the resultant blue glow from the core was seen by five of the seven persons facing the assembly. Similar to LA-1, the blue glow was caused by ionizing radiation interacting with the surrounding air. Charged particles such as electrons are emitted during the criticality excursion, and these electrons are able to promote electrons of gases in the air to a higher energy state without ionizing them. When the excited atom de-excites, it emits a photon of certain energy, which in this case is in the ultraviolet to visible light range. The blue glow mainly comes from Nitrogen’s deexcitation. 
<br><br>
Following this, almost immediately, Slotin threw the shell to the floor, ending the excursion. This allowed the $k_{eff}$ value of the system to drop below 1 and return to subcriticality as the amount of neutron leakage increases. 
<br><br>
When seen at the hospital, Slotin complained of numbness and tingling of his left thumb. Slotin would die 9 days later from acute radiation sickness. The radiation delivered to his body as a whole is estimated to have been equivalent to 19.30 Sieverts of 80-kV X-rays, 10 Sieverts of neutron radiation and 1.14 Sieverts of gamma rays.
<br><br>
The yield of this excursion was $3*10^{15} \text{ fissions}$. There was no plutonium contamination.
