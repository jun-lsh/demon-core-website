In the LA-2 accident, the 7 others present in the room at the time of the accident would die years after the accident itself.
<br><br>
The first to go was Private Cleary, the security guard present at the accident. He was the individual who returned to the assembly following the accident to place film badges on it as well as perform radiation measurements in the room. He would die 4 years later in the Korean War.
<br><br>
The others would die no less than 19 years after the accident itself. 
<br><br>
As stated in the official reports, Cieslicki’s death, caused by leukaemia 19 years after the LA-2 accident, may have been a result of late radiation exposure. Hemmerly, the guard present at LA-1, would also die from leukaemia 33 years after exposure, but genetic factors may have been at play.
<br><br>
Even in the case of Graves, who died 19 years after LA-2 from a heart attack, the damage to his thyroid gland which may have later led to his heart attack cannot be directly attributed to radiation exposure as genetic factors may have contributed.
<br><br>
Daghlian and Slotin, on the other hand (no pun intended), served as crucial case studies in acute radiation sickness, with their treatment, suffering and death being fully documented. 
<br><br>
Los Alamos would shift to remote controlled operations following LA-2 to prevent such accidents from causing deathly harm to scientists in the future. Schreiber, a survivor of LA-2, was an engineer behind the remote control machines and cameras that Los Alamos would begin to use such that experiments could be performed over a quarter mile away. When asked whether that much distance was needed, Schreiber responded “well, we didn’t know”.
<br><br>
Now, what happened to the Demon Core after LA-2? Remember how Slotin was supposed to attend some nuclear weapon tests at Bikini Atoll? Those were the Operation Crossroads weapon tests, and it is often said that the Demon Core was used as the core for Gilda, the first bomb dropped in the test.
<br><br>
However, it was later revealed that this wasn’t the case. The core was meant to be used for a third test at Crossroads, but the test was cancelled. The core was simply still too radioactive for use. 
<br><br>
And thus, it was instead melted down, its plutonium used in other nuclear weapon cores in the years to come. For all we know, bits of the Demon Core could still be found in the nuclear weapons that the United States possesses to this day. 
<br><br>
The Demon Core has taught us a lot about nuclear safety, the risks involved and serves as a precautionary tale against hubris and arrogance as well as the potential radiation holds.
